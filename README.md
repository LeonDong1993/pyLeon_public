# About this repo
This is a comprehensive personal python library that is used across my python related projects. It mainly focus on Probalistic Graph Model (PGM) realted stuff, feel free to use it if you find it helpful.

# How to use this library 
## Step 1 
Download this repo to your local hard drive, rename it pyLeon.

## Step 2 
For linux/unix/macos, add the path of this repo into PYTHONPATH, this can be done by adding `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/repo:$PYTHONPATH` in your profile and then source it. 
For windows, you can do the same thing, but I suggest you create a symbolic in the 'site-packages' folder of your python, or you can just move the whole repo into the 'site-packages' folder.
